# Calculator Game

This is an interactive calculator program in Python that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations continuously. The calculator supports:

âœ” Addition (+)

âœ” Subtraction (-)

âœ” Multiplication (*)

âœ” Division (/) (integer division)

How It Works:

1.The user enters the first number.
2. The calculator displays available operations (+, -, *, /).
3. The user selects an operation and enters the second number.
4. The program calculates and displays the result.
The user can choose to:
   a. Continue calculating with the current result (y).
   b. Start a new calculation (n), which clears the screen and restarts.
   c. Exit the program (x).
   
The calculator loops until the user chooses to exit, making it a useful tool for performing multiple calculations in one session. ðŸ”¢ðŸ’¡
